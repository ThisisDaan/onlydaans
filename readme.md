# Only Daans - A GitHub Pages Website

Welcome to "Only Daans," the most exclusive (and humorous) website dedicated to everyone named Daan! This is a simple static website built with HTML and CSS, perfect for hosting on GitHub Pages.

## What is this?

It's a joke website based on "OnlyFans," but tailored for Daans. The content is SFW and aims for a lighthearted, fun experience.

## How to Deploy to GitHub Pages

1.  **Create a new repository on GitHub:**

    - Go to [GitHub](https://github.com) and create a new public repository. You can name it something like `only-daans` or `yourusername.github.io` if you want it to be your main GitHub Pages site.

2.  **Add these files to your repository:**

    - Clone your new repository to your local machine:
      ```bash
      git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPOSITORY_NAME.git
      cd YOUR_REPOSITORY_NAME
      ```
    - Copy `index.html`, `style.css`, and this `README.md` file into the repository folder.
    - Commit and push the files:
      ```bash
      git add .
      git commit -m "Initial Daan-tastic website setup"
      git push origin main
      ```
      (Your default branch might be `master` instead of `main`).

3.  **Enable GitHub Pages:**

    - Go to your repository on GitHub.
    - Click on the "Settings" tab.
    - In the left sidebar, click on "Pages" (under "Code and automation").
    - Under "Build and deployment", for the "Source", select "Deploy from a branch".
    - Choose the branch you pushed your code to (e.g., `main` or `master`) and the `/(root)` folder.
    - Click "Save".

4.  **Visit your site!**
    - GitHub Pages will build and deploy your site. It might take a minute or two.
    - The URL will typically be `https://YOUR_USERNAME.github.io/YOUR_REPOSITORY_NAME/` (if you used a project repository) or `https://YOUR_USERNAME.github.io/` (if you named your repository `YOUR_USERNAME.github.io`). You'll see the URL on the GitHub Pages settings page once it's live.

Enjoy your new "Only Daans" website! Feel free to customize the content and styles further.
